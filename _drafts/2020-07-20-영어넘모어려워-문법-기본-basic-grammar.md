## UNIT 3: I am doing (현재진행 present continuous/present progressive)

어떤 일이 지금 벌어지고 있는 중을 표현하는 형태.

```
subject + [not +] be-verb + verb-ing(gerund)
```

| 주어 | be동사     | 동명사 |
|------|-----------|------|
| I    | am [not]  | -ing |
| he   | is [not]  | -ing |
| she  | is [not]  | -ing |
| it   | is [not]  | -ing |
| we   | are [not] | -ing |
| you  | are [not] | -ing |
| they | are [not] | -ing |

### examples

- I'm not reading a newspaper.
- She's watching television.

- They are builddig a new hotel downtown.

### violet

> The present continuous (also called present progressive) is a verb tense which is used to show that an ongoing action is happening now, either at the moment of speech or now in a larger sense.
>
> SPELLING REMINDERS FOR PRESENT PARTICIPLE
> present participle form : verb + ing
>
> 1. for some verbs ending in "e", you have to remove it and add -ing OR change "e" to "y" then add -ing
> example: come - coming / love - loving / dance - dancing
> example: lie - lying
>
> 2. for some verbs ending in consonants, you have to double the last letter then add -ing
> example: run - running / sit - sitting / swim - swimming

### 동명사의 철자 규칙

일반적인 규칙은 다음과 같다:

- `e`가 아닌 모음은 뒤에 `-ing`를 더함: play => playing
- `e`로 끝나면 `e`를 `-ing`로 대체: come => coming, write => writing
- 자음으로 끝나면 자음을 하나 더 붙이고 `-ing`를 더함: run => running, sit => sitting

하지만 **이것은 '일반적인' 규칙에 불과하며 예외가 많다**:

- lie => lying
- stand => standing
- listen => listening

## UNIT 4: are you doing? (현재진행 의문문 present continuous question statement)

어떤 일이 벌어지고 있는지 묻는 형태.

```
[wh-question word + ]be-verb + subject + [not +] verb-ing(gerund) + ?
```

| be동사 | 주어   | gerund  |
|------  |------ |-------|
| am     | I     | -ing? |
| is     | he    | -ing? |
| is     | she   | -ing? |
| is     | it    | -ing? |
| are    | we    | -ing? |
| are    | you   | -ing? |
| are    | they  | -ing? |

### examples

- Am I saying correctly?
- Is it rainning?
- Is that clock working?
- Are the children playing?
- Are you not listening to me?
- Where is she going?
- Why are you crying?
- What are they looking at?
- where are your friends going?

## UNIT 5: I do/work/like (단순현재 simple present)

단순현재는 일반적인 사실 또는 항상/때때로 일어나는 일에 대해 사용한다.

```
subject + verb
```

### examples

*부사(adverb)*는 동사 앞이나 뒤 어느 곳에나 있을 수 있음.

- I *never* go to the movies.
- I *often* forget people's names.
- We *never* have dinner.

### violet

> A. simple present --> singular / plural forms of the verb
> --> format: subject + verb
>
> SINGULAR
> -- add -s / - es to make a word singular
> -- if the word is ending in -y, change -y to -i and then add -es
> -- if the word is ending in either -sh / -ch, just add -es
>
> EXAMPLE:
> play -- plays
> try -- tries
> finish -- finishes
> watch -- watches
> read -- reads
> love -- loves
> break -- breaks
> cook -- cooks
>
> PLURAL
> -- no need to add anything
> -- base form of the verb is already plural
>
> B. WHEN TO USE THE SIMPLE PRESENT TENSE?
> -- we use the simple present tense for things that are true in general (facts)
> -- we also use the simple present tense for things that happen repeatedly or all the time (routines / habits)
>
> C. ALWAYS / NEVER / OFTEN / USUALLY / SOMETIMES + SIMPLE PRESENT
> -- we can use these words and combine it with the present tense of the verb

### 복수 동사/단수 동사

| 1인칭 단수 | 1인칭 복수 | 2인칭 단수 | 2인칭 복수 | 3인칭 단수 | 3인칭 복수 |
|--------   |--------    |--------   |--------   |--------   |--------    |
| do        | do         | do        | do        | does      | do         |
| have      | have       | have      | have      | has       | have       |
| eat       | eat        | eat       | eat       | eats      | eat        |
| show      | show       | show      | show      | shows     | show       |
| find      | find       | find      | find      | finds     | find       |
| go        | go         | go        | go        | goes      | go         |

- 주어가 3인칭 단수일 땐 단수 동사를, 그 외의 경우엔 모두 복수 동사를 사용한다. 그래서 viel이 "You and I is alawys plural-verb"라고 함.  
- 셀 수 없는 단어는 단수로 취급함: water 등  
- *subject verb agreement*의 일부인듯?
- 소유격의 대상(my PC, your book)은 3인칭임.

### 단수 동사(singular verb)의 철자 규칙

- `-s`, `-sh`, `-ch` 뒤에는 `-es`를 붙임: pass => passes, finish => finishes, watch => watches
- `-y`는 `-ies`로 대체: study => studies, try => tries
- do => does, go => goes
- 이 외의 경우 뒤에 `-s`를 붙임: like => likes, cost => costs, work => works
- 예외는 있음: enjoy => enjoys

## UNIT 6: I don't... (단순현재 부정문 simple present negative)

단순현재 부정문은 문장 내에 `do/does + not`이 있어야 한다.

```
subject + do/does + not + verb
```

### examples

- I don't like to wash the car. I don't do it very often.
- I do not often eat oatmeal.
- You don't do the same thing every day.
- We don't watch television very often.
- They don't know my phone number.
- The weather is usually nice. It doesn't rain very often: 날씨는 보통 좋다. 비는 자주 내리지 않는다.

### violet

> A. NEGATIVE
> --> format: subject + do/does + not + verb
>
> B. SINGULAR SUBJECTS
> --> he / she / it + does + not
>
> PLURAL SUBJECTS
> --> I / you / we / they + do + not
>
> C. IMPORTANT REMINDER
> --> whenever we use do / don't / does / doesn't, the verb that follows will always be in the BASE FORM

### do/don't/does/doesn't/did/didn't 다음 동사는 동사원형(infinitive)

**중요**: 앞의 does/doesn't가 3인칭 단수이므로 뒤따르는 동사는 동사원형이다:

- Jane *doesn't play* the piano very well.
- She speaks Spanish, but she *doesn't speak* Italian.
- Bill *doesn't do* his job very well.
- Paula *doesn't* usually *have* breakfast.

did/didn't가 이미 시제를 나타내므로 뒤따르는 동사는 동사원형이다:

- She *did work*.
- He *didn't do* that.

## UNIT 7: Do you ...? (단순현재 의문문 simple present question)

```
do/does + subject + infinitive + ?
```

| wh-question | do/does | 주어          | 부사    | 동사원형 | 목적어           |
|-------------|---------|--------------|---------|-------  |------------------|
|             | Do      | you          |         | work    | on Sundays?      |
|             | Do      | your friends |         | live    | near here?       |
|             | Does    | Chris        |         | play    | tennis?          |
| Where       | do      | your parents |         | live?   |                  |
| How often   | do      | you          |         | wash    | your hair?       |
| What        | does    | this word    |         | mean?   |                  |
| How much    | does    | it           |         | cost    | to fly to Tokyo? |
|             | Do      | you          | always  | have    | breakfast?       |
|             | Does    | Chris        | ever    | call    | you?             |
| What        | do      | you          | usually | do      | on weekends?     |

위 표에 따르면 형식은:

```
[wh-question word +] do/does + 주어(subject) + [부사 +] 동사원형(infinitive) [+ 목적어(object)] + ?
```

이지만, 그렇지 않은 경우도 있다: *How much money do we have?*

### examples

- Do they play tennis/Do toms friends play tennis?
- Do you play tennis every morning?
- Do you work on saturdays?
- Does he like his job?
- Does it often snow?
- Does Lucy live near here?

## UNIT 17: How long have you ...? (현재완료 진행 present perfect continuous/progressive)

현재완료 진행은 과거에 시작되었으며 현재까지도 진행 중인 어떤 사건을 표현할 때 사용한다.  
'현재까지도 진행 중'의 의미는 지금 당장 일어나고 있는 사건이라고 이해하면 쉽다. 예를 들어 '1시간 전부터 지금까지도 비가 내리고 있다.'는 현재완료 진행으로 표현한다.

```
평서문/부정문
subject + have/has(not) + been + verb-ing

의문문
have/has + subject + been + verb-ing + ?

부정의문문
have/has + subject + not + been + verb-ing + ?
hasn't/haven't + subject + been + verb-ing + ?
```

## UNIT 18: for, since, ago

## 타동사

> face north: 북쪽을 바라봐

여기서 face는 전치사(preposition)가 필요없는 타동사임. 타동사는 목적어가 항상 필요하며 전치사 없이 쓰인다.  
예외로 to 부정사와 함께 쓰이는 경우가 있는데, **to 부정사는 to를 포함하여 명사로 취급**하기 때문에 전치사라 보면 안된다고 한다.
