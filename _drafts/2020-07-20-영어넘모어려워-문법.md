## you and i is alawys plural-verb?

~~이게 뭔 소리람...~~  
동사도 명사처럼 시점과 단/복수에 따라 모양이 달라지는데, 사실 3인칭 단수를 제외하면 모두 같다:

| 1인칭 단수 | 1인칭 복수 | 2인칭 단수 | 2인칭 복수 | 3인칭 단수 | 3인칭 복수 |
|--------   |--------    |--------   |--------   |--------   |--------    |
| do        | do         | do        | do        | does      | do         |
| have      | have       | have      | have      | has       | have       |
| eat       | eat        | eat       | eat       | eats      | eat        |
| show      | show       | show      | show      | shows     | show       |
| find      | find       | find      | find      | finds     | find       |
| go        | go         | go        | go        | goes      | go         |

뿡순이의 설명에 따르면 'you와 I는 언제나 복수 동사와 쓰인다'라는 말은, you(2인칭)와 I(1인칭)와 함께 쓰이는 동사는 단수/복수 구분 없이 같으므로 늘 복수동사라고 생각하는 편이 외우기 쉽다는 말이다.

## i am doing: 현재진행 present continuous/present progressive

```
be동사(am/is/are) [+ not +] 동사-ing  
```

- I'm not reading a newspaper.
- She's watching television.
- Jane isn't having dinner.
- They are builddig a new hotel downtown.

일반적인 철자 규칙은:

- 'e'로 끝나면 'e'를 'ing'로 대체: come - coming, write - writing
- 자음으로 끝나면 자음을 하나 더 붙이고 'ing'를 더함: run - running, sit - sitting

이지만 이것은 '일반적인' 규칙이며 예외가 꽤 많다:

- lie - lying

> The present continuous (also called present progressive) is a verb tense which is used to show that an ongoing action is happening now, either at the moment of speech or now in a larger sense.
>
> SPELLING REMINDERS FOR PRESENT PARTICIPLE
> present participle form : verb + ing
>
> 1. for some verbs ending in "e", you have to remove it and add -ing OR change "e" to "y" then add -ing
> example: come - coming / love - loving / dance - dancing
> example: lie - lying
>
> 2. for some verbs ending in consonants, you have to double the last letter then add -ing
> example: run - running / sit - sitting / swim - swimming
