## i am doing: 현재진행 present continuous/present progressive

어떤 일이 지금 벌어지고 있는 중을 표현하는 형태.

```
be동사(am/is/are) + [not +] 동명사(gerund)
```

| 주어 | be동사     | 동명사 |
|------|-----------|------|
| I    | am [not]  | -ing |
| he   | is [not]  | -ing |
| she  | is [not]  | -ing |
| it   | is [not]  | -ing |
| we   | are [not] | -ing |
| you  | are [not] | -ing |
| they | are [not] | -ing |

> The present continuous (also called present progressive) is a verb tense which is used to show that an ongoing action is happening now, either at the moment of speech or now in a larger sense.
>
> SPELLING REMINDERS FOR PRESENT PARTICIPLE
> present participle form : verb + ing
>
> 1. for some verbs ending in "e", you have to remove it and add -ing OR change "e" to "y" then add -ing
> example: come - coming / love - loving / dance - dancing
> example: lie - lying
>
> 2. for some verbs ending in consonants, you have to double the last letter then add -ing
> example: run - running / sit - sitting / swim - swimming

#### examples

- I'm not reading a newspaper.
- She's watching television.
- Jane isn't having dinner.
- They are builddig a new hotel downtown.

### 동명사의 철자 규칙

일반적인 규칙은 다음과 같다:

- 'e'가 아닌 모음은 뒤에 'ing'를 더함: play => playing
- 'e'로 끝나면 'e'를 'ing'로 대체: come => coming, write => writing
- 자음으로 끝나면 자음을 하나 더 붙이고 'ing'를 더함: run => running, sit => sitting

하지만 **이것은 '일반적인' 규칙에 불과하며 예외가 많다**:

- lie => lying
- stand => standing
- listen => listening

## are you doing?: 현재진행 의문문 present continuous question statement

어떤 일이 벌어지고 있는지 묻는 형태.

```
[wh-question word + ]be동사 + 주어(subject) + [not +] 동명사(gerund)
```

| be동사 | 주어   | gerund  |
|------  |------ |-------|
| am     | I     | -ing? |

| is     | it    | -ing? |
| are    | we    | -ing? |
| are    | you   | -ing? |
| are    | they  | -ing? |

> A. POSITIVE FORMAT
> --> subject + be-verb + verb-ing (gerund)
>
> QUESTION FORMAT
> --> be-verb + subject + verb-ing (gerund) + ?
>
> B.
> QUESTION FORMAT plus WH-QUESTION WORD
> --> wh-question word + be-verb + subject + verb-ing (gerund) + ?
>
> C. SHORT POSITIVE ANSWER
> --> yes + subject + be-verb
>
> SHORT NEGATIVE ANSWER
> --> no + subject + be-verb + not
>
> GERUND

## I do/work/like: 단순현재 simple present

단순현재는 일반적인 사실 또는 항상/때때로 일어나는 일에 대해 사용한다.

```
주어(subject) + 동사(verb)
```

> A. simple present --> singular / plural forms of the verb
> --> format: subject + verb
>
> SINGULAR
> -- add -s / - es to make a word singular
> -- if the word is ending in -y, change -y to -i and then add -es
> -- if the word is ending in either -sh / -ch, just add -es
>
> EXAMPLE:
> play -- plays
> try -- tries
> finish -- finishes
> watch -- watches
> read -- reads
> love -- loves
> break -- breaks
> cook -- cooks
>
> PLURAL
> -- no need to add anything
> -- base form of the verb is already plural
>
> B. WHEN TO USE THE SIMPLE PRESENT TENSE?
> -- we use the simple present tense for things that are true in general (facts)
> -- we also use the simple present tense for things that happen repeatedly or all the time (routines / habits)
>
> C. ALWAYS / NEVER / OFTEN / USUALLY / SOMETIMES + SIMPLE PRESENT
> -- we can use these words and combine it with the present tense of the verb

#### examples

*부사(adverb)*는 동사 앞이나 뒤 어느 곳에나 있을 수 있음.

- I *never* go to the movies.
- I *often* forget people's names.
- We *never* have dinner.
- They read *a lot*.
- He likes ice cream.

- Children *usually* like chocolate.

- Banks *usually* open at 9:00 in the morning.
- Julia *always* enjoys parties.

### 복수 동사/단수 동사

| 1인칭 단수 | 1인칭 복수 | 2인칭 단수 | 2인칭 복수 | 3인칭 단수 | 3인칭 복수 |
|--------   |--------    |--------   |--------   |--------   |--------    |
| do        | do         | do        | do        | does      | do         |
| have      | have       | have      | have      | has       | have       |
| eat       | eat        | eat       | eat       | eats      | eat        |
| show      | show       | show      | show      | shows     | show       |
| find      | find       | find      | find      | finds     | find       |
| go        | go         | go        | go        | goes      | go         |

- 주어가 3인칭 단수일 땐 단수 동사를, 그 외의 경우엔 모두 복수 동사를 사용한다. 그래서 viel이 "You and I is alawys plural-verb"라고 함.  
- 셀 수 없는 단어는 단수로 취급함: water 등  
- *subject verb agreement*의 일부인듯?

### 단수 동사(singular verb)의 철자 규칙

- `-s`, `-sh`, `-ch` 뒤에는 `-es`를 붙임: pass => passes, finish => finishes, watch => watches
- `-y`는 `-ies`로 대체: study => studies, try => tries
- do => does, go => goes
- 이 외의 경우 뒤에 `-s`를 붙임: like => likes, cost => costs, work => works
- 예외는 있음: enjoy => enjoys

## I don't...: 단순현재 부정문 simple present negative

```
주어(subject) + do/does + not + 동사(verb)
```

> A. NEGATIVE
> --> format: subject + do/does + not + verb
>
> B. SINGULAR SUBJECTS
> --> he / she / it + does + not
>
> PLURAL SUBJECTS
> --> I / you / we / they + do + not
>
> C. IMPORTANT REMINDER
> --> whenever we use do / don't / does / doesn't, the verb that follows will always be in the BASE FORM

#### examples

- I do not often eat oatmeal.
- You don't do the same thing every day.
- We don't watch television very often.
- They don't know my phone number.
- The weather is usually nice. It doesn't rain very often: 날씨는 보통 좋다. 비는 자주 내리지 않는다.

## do/don't/does/doesn't/did/didn't 다음 동사는 동사원형(infinitive)

앞의 does/doesn't가 3인칭 단수이므로 뒤따르는 동사는 동사원형이다:

- Jane *doesn't play* the piano very well.
- She speaks Spanish, but she *doesn't speak* Italian.
- Bill *doesn't do* his job very well.
- Paula *doesn't* usually *have* breakfast.

did/didn't가 이미 시제를 나타내므로 뒤따르는 동사는 동사원형이다:

- She *did work*.
- He *didn't do* that.

## Do you...?: 단순현재 의문문 simple present question

```
[wh-question word +] do/does + 주어(subject) + [부사 +] 동사원형(infinitive) [+ 목적어(object)]

| What        | do      | you          | usually | do      | on weekends?     |

## 타동사

> face north: 북쪽을 바라봐

여기서 face는 전치사(preposition)가 필요없는 타동사임. 타동사는 목적어가 항상 필요하며 전치사 없이 쓰인다.  
예외로 to 부정사와 함께 쓰이는 경우가 있는데, **to 부정사는 to를 포함하여 명사로 취급**하기 때문에 전치사라 보면 안된다고 한다.

## have 과거분사
