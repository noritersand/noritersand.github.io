## 리포트에 없을까봐 메모

- i think not all companies should follow suit this kind of "new normal" because it's a case to case basis type of thing.

## another vs other vs others

- another: (adjective/pronoun) one more, an extra, an additional, an alternative, a different
  - e.g.: we have another book for you (another + singular noun)
- other: (adjective/pronoun) more in addition to the one(s) already mentioned, alternative, different
  - e.g.: we have other books for you (other + plural noun)
  - e.g.: these shoes are too small. do you have any other shoes?
- others: (pronoun/noun) replaces other + plural noun, others is not followed by a noun, others = other people
  - e.g.: these shoes are too small. do you have any others?

## you and i is alawys plural-verb?

뭔 소리지...
