## UNIT 3: I am doing (현재진행 present continuous/present progressive)

어떤 일이 지금 벌어지고 있는 중을 표현하는 형태.

```
subject [+ not] + be-verb + verb-ing(gerund)
```

| 주어 | be동사     | 동명사 |
|------|-----------|------|
| I    | am [not]  | -ing |
| he   | is [not]  | -ing |
| she  | is [not]  | -ing |
| it   | is [not]  | -ing |
| we   | are [not] | -ing |
| you  | are [not] | -ing |
| they | are [not] | -ing |

### examples

- I'm not reading a newspaper.
- She's watching television.

### violet

> The present continuous (also called present progressive) is a verb tense which is used to show that an ongoing action is happening now, either at the moment of speech or now in a larger sense.
>
> SPELLING REMINDERS FOR PRESENT PARTICIPLE
> present participle form : verb + ing
>
> 1. for some verbs ending in "e", you have to remove it and add -ing OR change "e" to "y" then add -ing
> example: come - coming / love - loving / dance - dancing
> example: lie - lying
>
> 2. for some verbs ending in consonants, you have to double the last letter then add -ing
> example: run - running / sit - sitting / swim - swimming

### 동명사의 철자 규칙

일반적인 규칙은 다음과 같다:

- `e`가 아닌 모음은 뒤에 `-ing`를 더함: play => playing
- `e`로 끝나면 `e`를 `-ing`로 대체: come => coming, write => writing
- 자음으로 끝나면 자음을 하나 더 붙이고 `-ing`를 더함: run => running, sit => sitting

하지만 **이것은 '일반적인' 규칙에 불과하며 예외가 많다**:

- lie => lying
- stand => standing
- listen => listening

## UNIT 4: are you doing? (현재진행 의문문 present continuous question statement)

어떤 일이 벌어지고 있는지 묻는 형태.

```
[wh-question word +] be-verb + subject [+ not] + verb-ing(gerund) + ?
```

| be동사 | 주어   | gerund  |
|------  |------ |-------|
| am     | I     | -ing? |
| is     | he    | -ing? |
| is     | she   | -ing? |
| is     | it    | -ing? |
| are    | we    | -ing? |
| are    | you   | -ing? |
| are    | they  | -ing? |

### examples

- Am I saying correctly?
- Is it rainning?
- Is that clock working?
- Are the children playing?
- Are you not listening to me?
- Where is she going?
- Why are you crying?
- What are they looking at?
- where are your friends going?

## UNIT 5: I do/work/like (단순현재 simple present)

단순현재는 일반적인 사실 또는 항상/때때로 일어나는 일에 대해 사용한다.

```
subject + verb
```

### examples

*부사(adverb)*는 동사 앞이나 뒤 어느 곳에나 있을 수 있음.

- I *never* go to the movies.
- I *often* forget people's names.

### violet

> A. simple present --> singular / plural forms of the verb
> --> format: subject + verb
>
> SINGULAR
> -- add -s / - es to make a word singular
> -- if the word is ending in -y, change -y to -i and then add -es
> -- if the word is ending in either -sh / -ch, just add -es
>
> EXAMPLE:
> play -- plays
> try -- tries
> finish -- finishes
> watch -- watches
> read -- reads
> love -- loves
> break -- breaks
> cook -- cooks
>
> PLURAL
> -- no need to add anything
> -- base form of the verb is already plural
>
> B. WHEN TO USE THE SIMPLE PRESENT TENSE?
> -- we use the simple present tense for things that are true in general (facts)
> -- we also use the simple present tense for things that happen repeatedly or all the time (routines / habits)
>
> C. ALWAYS / NEVER / OFTEN / USUALLY / SOMETIMES + SIMPLE PRESENT
> -- we can use these words and combine it with the present tense of the verb

### 복수 동사/단수 동사

| 1인칭 단수 | 1인칭 복수 | 2인칭 단수 | 2인칭 복수 | 3인칭 단수 | 3인칭 복수 |
|--------   |--------    |--------   |--------   |--------   |--------    |
| do        | do         | do        | do        | does      | do         |
| have      | have       | have      | have      | has       | have       |
| eat       | eat        | eat       | eat       | eats      | eat        |
| show      | show       | show      | show      | shows     | show       |
| find      | find       | find      | find      | finds     | find       |
| go        | go         | go        | go        | goes      | go         |

- 주어가 3인칭 단수일 땐 단수 동사를, 그 외의 경우엔 모두 복수 동사를 사용한다. 그래서 viel이 "You and I is alawys plural-verb"라고 함.  
- 셀 수 없는 단어는 단수로 취급함: water 등  
- *subject verb agreement*의 일부인듯?
- 소유격의 대상(my PC, your book)은 3인칭임.

단수 동사(singular verb)의 철자 규칙:

- `-s`, `-sh`, `-ch` 뒤에는 `-es`를 붙임: pass => passes, finish => finishes, watch => watches
- `-y`는 `-ies`로 대체: study => studies, try => tries
- do => does, go => goes
- 이 외의 경우 뒤에 `-s`를 붙임: like => likes, cost => costs, work => works
- 예외는 있음: enjoy => enjoys

## UNIT 6: I don't... (단순현재 부정문 simple present negative)

단순현재 부정문은 문장 내에 `do/does + not`이 있어야 한다.

```
subject + do/does + not + verb
```

### examples

- I don't like to wash the car. I don't do it very often.
- I do not often eat oatmeal.
- You don't do the same thing every day.
- We don't watch television very often.
- They don't know my phone number.
- The weather is usually nice. It doesn't rain very often: 날씨는 보통 좋다. 비는 자주 내리지 않는다.

### violet

> A. NEGATIVE
> --> format: subject + do/does + not + verb
>
> B. SINGULAR SUBJECTS
> --> he / she / it + does + not
>
> PLURAL SUBJECTS
> --> I / you / we / they + do + not
>
> C. IMPORTANT REMINDER
> --> whenever we use do / don't / does / doesn't, the verb that follows will always be in the BASE FORM

### do/don't/does/doesn't/did/didn't 다음 동사는 동사원형(base form of the verb)

**앞의 does/doesn't가 3인칭 단수이므로 뒤따르는 동사는 동사원형이다**:

- Jane *doesn't play* the piano very well.
- She speaks Spanish, but she *doesn't speak* Italian.
- Bill *doesn't do* his job very well.
- Paula *doesn't* usually *have* breakfast.

**did/didn't가 이미 시제를 나타내므로 뒤따르는 동사는 동사원형이다**:

- She *did work*.
- He *didn't do* that.

## UNIT 7: Do you ...? (단순현재 의문문 simple present question)

```
do/does + subject + infinitive + ?
```

| wh-question | do/does | 주어          | 부사    | 동사원형 | 목적어           |
|-------------|---------|--------------|---------|-------  |------------------|
|             | Do      | you          |         | work    | on Sundays?      |
|             | Do      | your friends |         | live    | near here?       |
|             | Does    | Chris        |         | play    | tennis?          |
| Where       | do      | your parents |         | live?   |                  |
| How often   | do      | you          |         | wash    | your hair?       |
| What        | does    | this word    |         | mean?   |                  |
| How much    | does    | it           |         | cost    | to fly to Tokyo? |
|             | Do      | you          | always  | have    | breakfast?       |
|             | Does    | Chris        | ever    | call    | you?             |
| What        | do      | you          | usually | do      | on weekends?     |

위 표에 따르면 형식은:

```
[wh-question +] do/does + subject [+ adverb] + infinitive [+ object] + ?
```

이지만, 그렇지 않은 경우도 있다: *How much money do we have?*

### examples

- *Do they play* tennis/Do toms friends play tennis?
- *Do you play* tennis every morning?
- *Do you work* on saturdays?
- *Does he like* his job?
- *Does it* often *snow*?

## UNIT 17: How long have you ...? (현재완료 진행 present perfect continuous/progressive)

현재완료 진행은 과거에 시작되었으며 현재까지도 진행 중인 어떤 사건을 표현할 때 사용한다.  
'현재까지도 진행 중'의 의미는 지금 당장 일어나고 있는 사건이라고 이해하면 쉽다. 예를 들어 '1시간 전부터 지금까지도 비가 내리고 있다.'는 현재완료 진행으로 표현한다.

```
평서문/부정문
subject + have/has [+ not] + been + verb-ing

의문문
have/has + subject + been + verb-ing + ?

부정의문문
have/has + subject + not + been + verb-ing + ?
hasn't/haven't + subject + been + verb-ing + ?
```

## UNIT 18: for, since, ago

for와 since는 기간(period, how long)에 대해 말할 때 사용한다.

```
for + 기간(three days, two years, ...)

since + 시작점 (Monday, 9:00, 2020, ...)
```

## UNIT 24: 현제시제와 과거시제에서 be/have/do

현재진행은 지금도 계속되고 있는 행동이나 어떤 것을 표현할 때 사용한다.  
그리고 **미래에 어떤 행동이 일어날 것임을 표현할 수 있다**.

- What *are* you *doing* tonight?
- "What *are* you *having* for lunch?" "I *am having* lobster for lunch."

과거진행은 과거의 어느 특정 시점에서 일어나고 있던 일, 그 시점에서의 계속적인 행동을 표현할 때 사용한다.  
과거진행은 limited duration을 나타내며, 따라서 어떤 일이 다른 사건에 의해 중단되었음을 나타내는 편리한 방법이다. (incomplete action)

- I *was sleeping* on the couch when Bertie *smashed through* the door.

현재완료와 단순현재, 단순과거는 생략함.

현재진행은 지금 일어나고 있는 일에 대해 말할 때 사용한다:

- "Where are Sue and Amanda?" "They*'re playing* tennis in the park."
- Please be quiet. *I'm working*.

현재진행은 미래(tomorrow, next week 등)에 대해 말할 때도 사용한다:

- Andrew *is playing* tennis tomorrow.
- *I'm* not *working* next week.

또, 이미 예정해놓거나 계획한 일을 표현할 때 사용하기도 한다:

- Sophie *is going* to the dentist on Friday.
- We*'re having* a party next weekend.
- *Are* you *meeting* your friends tonight?
- What *are* you *doing* tomorrow night?
- I*'m* not *working* next week.

**I am doing something tomorrow는 I am going to do something tomorrow와 의미가 같다**.

개인적으로 계획해놓은 일에 대해 말할 때는 현재진행을 사용하지만:

- *I'm staying* at home this evening.

**버스 운행, 영화 상영, 수업 시간과 같은 스케줄에 대해서는 단순현재**를 쓴다:

- The plane *arrives* in New York at 7:30 tomorrow morning.
- What time *does* the movie *end* tonight?

## UNIT 27: I'm going to ...

I'm going to do something: ...할 것이다, ...할 계획이다, ...하기로 결정했다, ...할 작정이다.

```
be-verb [+ not] + going to + verb
```

미래에 예정된 일을 표현하는 패턴:

1. `will + verb`: I *will travel* to Greece tomorrow
2. `be + present participle + something`: We *are having a party* next weekend.
3. `be going to + the base form of the verb`: I*'m going to take* a few exams at the end of the year.

### will과 be going to의 차이

will은 현재 시점에서 결정된 앞으로의 일(즉흥적인 미래), be going to는 현재 시점 기준 이전에 정해진 앞으로의 계획(계획적인 미래)을 말한다. 따라서 will은 언제든지 취소할 수 있는 것, be going to는 취소하기 힘든것 정도의 의미 차이가 있다.

어떤 상황에 대해서 표현할 때 근거가 없는 추측이라면 둘 다 사용할 수 있지만, 앞으로의 상황을 충분히 예상할 수 있는 근거가 있다면 be going to만 사용할 수 있다.

- Something *is going to happen*: 현재 상황으로 보아 어떤 일이 일어날 것이 분명하다.

```
평서문/부정문
subject + will [+ not] + base form of the verb

의문문
will + subject + base form of the verb + ?
```

will은 미래 시제를 표현하는 가장 기본적인 방법이다. 방금 결정한 일을 말하거나, 미래에 일어날 일을 예측하는 문장에서 사용한다.  
UNIT 27에서 설명했듯 이미 결정된 일이거나 취소하기 힘든 일, 그리고 앞으로 일어날 일에 대한 근거가 확실한 경우 will 대신 be goint to를 사용한다.

- I'm sure your aunt *will lend* us some money.
- Leave the old bread in the yard. The birds *will eat* it.
- I *won't be* here tomorrow.
- *Will* you *be* at home tonight?
- Don't drink coffe before you go to bed. You *won't sleep*.
- It *won't take* as long.

I think ... will ...이라는 표현이 많이 쓰인다:

- I *think* Kelly *will pass* her driver's test.
- I *don't think* it *will rain* this afternoon.
- *Do you think* the test *will be* difficult?

## UNIT 29: will 2 (will PART 2)

```
subject + will [+ not]
subject [+ don't/doesn't] + think + will
```

will은 무언가를 해주겠다고 제안하거나 어떤 것을 하겠다고 결심할 때도 사용한다:

- *I'll carry* it for you.
- *I'll call* you tomorrow.

어떤 일을 하기로 스스로 결심할 때 *I think*와 같이 자주 사용된다:

- I'm hungry. *I think I'll buy* something to eat.
- I'm tired. *I think I'll go* to bed early tonight.
- It's raining. *I don't think I'll go* out.

이미 결심한 일에 대해선 I'll을 쓰지 않는다:

- I*'m working* tomorrow.
- There's a good program on TV tonight. I*'m going to watch* it.

Shall I / Shall we ... ?: ...해도 될까요/괜찮을까요? (상대방의 의견을 물어보는 표현):

- *Shall I call* you tonight?
- What *shall we have* for dinner?

should도 같은 의미로 쓰인다:

- *Should I call* you tonight?: 오늘밤에 전화해도 될까요?
- What *should we have* for dinner?: 저녁으로 뭘 먹을까요?

## UNIT 30: might

I might: ... 할지도 모른다.

```
might [+ not] + base form of the verb
```

어떠한 일이 이뤄질지 아닐지 확신이 없을 때 사용하는 표현.
참고로 be going to는 100% 확신할 때 사용한다.

*may*는 might와 의미가 같다. 단, 가능성을 나타내는 뉘앙스가 다른데, might/possibly는 may/maybe/perhaps에 비해 가능성이 낮을 때 사용한다. 가령 may가 75%의 가능성을 예상한다면, might는 50% 정도라고 볼 수 있다.

- I *might* play tennis tomorrow.
- I *may* play tennis tomorrow.
- I will *possibly* play tennis tomorrow.
- *Maybe* I will play tennis tomorrow.
- *Perhaps* I will play tennis tomorrow.

**might와 may는 조동사(auxiliary-verb)이므로 동사 없이 사용할 수 없다.**

### examples

- I *might go* to the movies tonight, but I'm not sure. (= it is possible that I will go)
- I don't know. She *might call* this afternoon.
- Take an umbrella with you. It *might rain*.
- You *might be* lucky. Buy a lottery ticket.
- I *might not go* to work tomorrow.
- Sue *might not come* to the party.

## UNIT 31: can과 could (can and could)

can은 어떤 일을 할 수 있는지를, 혹은 그 방법을 알고 있는지를 표현하는데 사용한다.

```
평서문:
subject + can [+ not] + base form of the verb [sentence]

의문문:
can [+ not] + subject + base form of the verb? [question]
```

- I *can play* the piano. My brother *can play* the piano, too.
- Sarah *can speak* Italian, but she *can't speak* Spanish.
- *Can* you *swim*?
- *Can* I *have* change for a dollar, please?

*could*는 과거에 어떤 일을 할 수 있었는지 없었는지에 대해 표현할 때 쓰인다.  
이 때 **could/couldn't가 이미 시제를 나타내므로 뒤따르는 동사는 동사원형이다**:

- When I was young, I *could run* very fast.
- Before Maria came to the United States, she *couldn't understand* much English. Now she *can understand* everything.
- I was tired last night, but I *couldn't sleep*.

의문문에서는 (공식적인 사항이나 규칙따위는 아니지만) 원어민들에게는 can보다 could가 좀 더 공손하게 쓰인다고 한다.

> "could" definitely sounds slightly more polite than "can" to a native speaker since it is less direct and more deferential as a result.
>
> "could" is a form of "can", so both are technically asking "are you able to...". this is not the difference between the two.

- *Can you* open the door, please? / *Could you* open the door, please?
- *Can you* wait a minute, please? / *Could you* wait a minute, please?

## UNIT 32: must

우리가 뭔가 사실이거나 사실이 아니라고 믿을 때, 혹은 뭔가를 할 필요가 있음을 표현하기 위해 사용한다.

```
subject + must (not) + base form of the verb
```

must: ...임에 틀림없다:

- You worked 10 hours today. You *must be* tired.
- My brother has worked at your company for years. You *must know* him.

must not: ...가 아닌게 틀림없다:

You must do something: ...해야 한다:

You must not do something: ...하지 않아야 한다:

- Bicyclists *must not ride* on the sidewalk.
- You *must not be* late for school again!

## UNIT 33: should

- Tome doesn't study enough. He *should study* harder.
- It's a good movie. You *should go* and see it.
- When you play tennis, you *should* always *watch* the ball.

Should I/we do something?: ...하는 게 좋을까?/...해야 하나?

I don't think ... should: ...하지 않는 게 좋겠다.

- *I don't think* you *should work* so hard.
- *I don't think* we *should go* yet. It's too early.

Do you think ... should ... ?: ...하는 게 좋을까?

반드시 해야해서 미루거나 취소할 수 없는 경우 have to를 사용한다::

- I *have to* study tonight. I can't go to the movies. (난 오늘밤 공부를 해야해서 극장에 갈 수 없어)

should 대신 **ought to**를 사용할 수 있다:

- I *ought to study* tonight, but I think I'll go to the movies.
- I think Lisa *ought to buy* some new clothes.

반드시 해야 하는 어떤 일을 표현할 때 사용한다.

```
평서문
subject + have/has/had + infinitive
```

I have to do ...: ...해야 할 의무가 있다, ...할 필요가 있다

- I'll be late for work tomorrow. I *have to go* to the dentist.
- You *have to pass* a test before you can get a driver's license.

과거 시제(yesterday/last week)에선 had to...를 사용한다:

## UNIT 35: Would you like ... ? I'd like ...

```
의문문:
would + subject + like + infinitive/noun

답변:
subject + would + like + infinitive/noun
```

Would you like ... ?: 뭔가를 하자고 청할 때(그렇다고 항상 '나와 같이'라는 의미는 아니다) 사용한다. Do you want보다 공손한 표현이다. (많은 언어에서와 같이 영어에서 want라는 동사는 매우 직접적인 표현으로 간주되며, would는 그것을 약간 부드럽게 만드는 효과가 있다.)

infinitive(to 부정사)가 오는 경우:

- *Would you like to go* for a walk?: 산책하실래요?
- *Would you like to go* to the movies tonight?
- What *would you like to drink*?: 뭘 드시겠어요?

명사가 오는 경우:

- *Would you like* a piece of candy?
- *Would you like* something to eat?

Would you like는 Do you like와 다르다:

- *Would you like* some coffee?: 커피 좀 드시겠어요?
- *Do you like* coffee?: 커피 좋아하세요?

I'd like ...: 원하는 바를 표현할 때 사용하며 I want 보다 공손한 표현이다.

- I'm thirsty. *I'd like* a drink.
- *I'd like* some information about hotels, please.
- I'm feeling tired. *I'd like to stay* home tonight.

대답에 사용할 때:

- "Would you like to have dinner with us on Sunday?" "Yes, *I'd love to*." (= I would love to have dinner with you)

## UNIT 36: I'd rather ...

어떤것을 다른것보다 선호한다고 표현할 때 사용한다.


```
평서문(regular/positive):
I'd rather + base form of the verb

부정문(negative)
I'd rather + not + base form of the verb

의문문(question)
Would + subject + rather + base form of the verb...?
```

I *would rather* do something: 나는 ... 하는게 더 좋다. (= I would prefer to do something)  
rather 뒤에는 to 없이 동사원형을 사용하는 것이 포인트

- I don't realy want to go out. I*'d rather stay* home. (= I'd prefer to stay home)
- I'd like to go now, but Tom *would rather wait* until later.
- I don't like to be late. I*'d rather be* early.

부정문에서 사용:

- I'm feeling tired. I*'d rather not go out* tonight.
- We're not hungry. We*'d rather not eat* yet.
- "Would you like to go out tonight?" "I*'d rather not*." (= I'd rather not go out)

의문문에서 사용:

- Which *would* you *rather do* go to the movies or watch a DVD at home?
- Which *would* you *rather be* a bus driver or an airplane pilot?
- "*Would* you *rather ahve* milk or juice?" "Juice, please."

I'd rather ... than ...: ...보다 ... 하는 게 더 좋다.

- I*'d rather* go out *than* stay home: 밖에 나가는 것보다 집에 있는 게 더 좋겠다.
- I*'d rather* have a dog *than* a cat.
- We*'d rather* go to the movies *than* watch a DVD at home.
- I*'d rather* be at home right now *than* here.

I would rather와 비슷한 말로 would prefer가 있는데, 이 경우 동사원형이 아니라 to 부정사가 뒤에 온다:

- I*'d rather sit* on the floor. / I*'d prefer to* sit on the floor.
- Sue *would rather* not *go* out. / Sue *would prefer* not *to go* out.

## UNIT 37: Do this! Don't do that! Let's do this!

- I'm not ready yet. Please *wait* for me.
- Please *be* quiet. I'm working.

## 타동사 transitive-verb

> face north: 북쪽을 바라봐

여기서 face는 전치사(preposition)가 필요없는 타동사임. 타동사는 목적어가 항상 필요하며 전치사 없이 쓰인다.
예외로 to 부정사와 함께 쓰이는 경우가 있는데, **to 부정사는 to를 포함하여 명사로 취급**하기 때문에 전치사라 보면 안된다고 한다.
