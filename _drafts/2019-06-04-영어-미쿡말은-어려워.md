> I think it's probably caused by cookies or caches.

> As requested, I went ahead and issued a refund back to the original payment method for this order: X96WB0BAFX3H1

> You should see the refund post within 3-5 business days. Please keep in mind that if we've issued the refund while the purchase was still in a "Pending" state on your card, when the refund is processed, it is likely that the pending charge will simply disappear, so there will be no record of the transaction at all. That's normal with most financial institutions.

> Let me know if you have any further questions or concerns and I'll be happy to help. Otherwise, take care!
